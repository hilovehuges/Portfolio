<h1> So my group made a circit where there was a button and if you pressed it both lights lit up <br>
So theres a jumper wire connected to a button and the button connected to another wire. The wire is connected to two LED's<br>
The two LED's are connected to a resistor that is connected to another jumper wire connected to 3.3V.<br>
