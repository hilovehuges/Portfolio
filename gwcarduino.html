<h1> So my group made a circit where there was a button and if you pressed it both lights lit up <br>
So theres a jumper wire connected to a button and the button connected to another wire. The wire is connected to two LED's<br>
The two LED's are connected to a resistor that is connected to another jumper wire connected to 3.3V.<br>
we had a struggle getting both LED's to light up but someone from another group helped us solve that problem. </h1>

<h2> 7/10/17 Day 8: I learned alot about robots today. Some I have never heard about or didn;'t think were robots. I am very excited to see where the future of<br>
  robots takes us in the future especially the 30 min drone delivery, that sounds really cool. Working on groups was reay fun and whenever <br>
  I had a problem someone in my group would have a fresh pair of eyes. I think next time if everyone had more tasks then we could do many more things with the<br>
  Arduino. I'm excited to see what everyone creates</h2>

<h1> I learned how to code more in arduino and how to use matrix's and for loop. It was really fun to see all the lights do whatever you <br>
wanted them too. I learned that you can turn two pins on at the smae time to make your LED with two colors make a whole new color.</h1>
