<h1>Python and Scratch both have loops and you can draw shapes. Alot of the vocab is the same except on python you have to type it all out by yourself. Python lets you do a lot more that you would like except you just have to go out and do that thing</h1>
<h1> I liked debugging my program it was a little fustrating but once I got it all to work it felt realy good. Also you learn lot from your mistakes which allows you to understand Python better. It was hard to just stare at something and just wonder what you did wrong. But it tells you where to look so you have an idea.</h1>

  <h1> 7/12/17 journal 11: Manuela and Ayanna's work is both centered around building robots that do a certian task. I think my team worked really well together and we got our lightshow to work. Our teamwork could have improved if we could all work on the code at th same time and them if people got to work on different parts it would have gone faster.<br>
    the basic pieces of every Arduino sketch are variables, and digitalWrite, and if you are working with LED's you can use delay, high, low.

<h1> 7/13/17 journal 12: I learned that the positive side faces the power sorce. I also learned how to wire things together. My favorite part about our robots dnce was when it started to do a spin and we actully wanted it too. <br>
  The outputs that Manuala Veloso and Ayanna Howard needed were related to movement. </h1>
    
<h1> 7/14/17 journal 13: I really liked working in a group on the robot. It was like watching our baby take its first steps.<br>
    </h1>

<h1> 7/18/17 journal 15: A list is a string of words or numbers that you can call to do different things in your code. When you want to <br>
  change something you can make a list and mi=anipulate it to your liking. I liked working with Anvita and Juhye I thought they were really fun.<br>
  We all got our work done and had a lot of fun playing with the code and doing different things, I think our cretivity feed each others. <br>
  I learned that everything is stored in servers and that your computer has to connect to a server to get data. I think LaTeX is a programming<br>
  language because you can use it to write math not relly chnge the look of a website. </h1>
    
<h1> 7/19/17 journal 16: I want to add more exciting images and colors to my django website but I'm exited to start blogging. I could create sites<br>
  that are there to give you information like my portfolio page. I'm excited to see what toher things I can do. </h1> 
    
 <h1> 7/24/17 journal 19: I think a lot of my information is on the internet although most of the time I do lie about my personal infrmation <br>
   The information is available because I sign up for most social media just to scope around and whenever there is a sign up with facebook <br>
   button I usually use it because it is so convinent. A programmer can take some extra steps to protect their users privacy, by making sure that<br>
   the password you enter is not just a word and is something secure. Latanya Sweeney and Shafi Goldwasser both show you that you should be <br>
   more thoughtful of what you put online. They built programs to show how easy it was to guess someones password. They work with computers to <br>
   make websites more secure so that you feel safe when getting on. It makes you feel less stressed about being online.</h1>
    
   <h1>Aditional Journal about final project: I liked working on games a lot when we got to build our games designed to be played that was really<br>
    fun. I woud like to learn how to hack into things and actually be able to figure out peoples passwords. I want to learn how to actually build <br>
    a really nice game and how to put it up on the apple store. I also want to learn how social media apps work and how the 'algorithms' they<br>
    talk about work. I want to see if we can make flying robots like drones and apply that knowledge to something useful. I want to explore ideas<br>
    that have to do with the environment and help make it a more simple task so people will do it more often. </h1>
    
  <h1> 7/26/17 journal 21: Python dictionaries allow you to group things together and potetially be able to sort them. I think data science<br>
    is really cool and it helps make a lot of sites more aware of their demographic. It would definetly help companies or the world where ever<br>
    you are applying this knowledge. I like algorithms beacuse that way you dont have to serch through a 500 page list of names of sort through <br>
    1000 books one by one. Algorithms are used all over technology to make things faster and easier to access for users.</h1>
    
  <h1> 7/27/17  journal 22: Using objects made it eaier to store things than to make a ton of variables like we originally intended too.<br>
    It was hard to get used to at first and I still don't really understand it but hopefully it will get better if I use it more. One problem <br>
    we solved was getting it to print and hold usernames. We struggled. </h1>
    
  <h1> 7/28/17 journal 23: I was most proud of figuring out how to print a list I thought that was really cool. I am so excited to work<br>
    with my group and create something that will hopefully help a lot of people and create chnge in the world.</h1>
    
   <h1> 7/30/17 journal 24: I think in order to be a more effective leader I should be more coragous when speaking up. I think in group <br>
     disscussions I should say what I have to say and not really hold back. I can write down all the things I shoud have said and see how much<br>
     I could have contributed. </h1>
    
   <h1> 8/2/17 journal 26: The greatest challege I have faced so far was trying to the the forms tutorial but turns out that it wasnt neccessary <br>
     I could develop more django skills so that I can make a website more easily. </h1>
    
   <h1> 8/3/17 journal 27: One thing that is going well is the teamwork I think we all work really well together and we want to get this <br>
     website to work. I need to improve on my page of knowing your rights. Our tem is really cool we like to bring food for each other and <br>
     brings us really close. I could get things to indent but Jen helped me fix my code. </h1>
