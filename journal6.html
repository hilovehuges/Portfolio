<h1>Python and Scratch both have loops and you can draw shapes. Alot of the vocab is the same except on python you have to type it all out by yourself. Python lets you do a lot more that you would like except you just have to go out and do that thing</h1>
<h1> I liked debugging my program it was a little fustrating but once I got it all to work it felt realy good. Also you learn lot from your mistakes which allows you to understand Python better. It was hard to just stare at something and just wonder what you did wrong. But it tells you where to look so you have an idea.</h1>
