<h1>Python and Scratch both have loops and you can draw shapes. Alot of the vocab is the same except on python you have to type it all out by yourself. Python lets you do a lot more that you would like except you just have to go out and do that thing</h1>
<h1> I liked debugging my program it was a little fustrating but once I got it all to work it felt realy good. Also you learn lot from your mistakes which allows you to understand Python better. It was hard to just stare at something and just wonder what you did wrong. But it tells you where to look so you have an idea.</h1>

  <h1> 7/12/17 journal 11: Manuela and Ayanna's work is both centered around building robots that do a certian task. I think my team worked really well together and we got our lightshow to work. Our teamwork could have improved if we could all work on the code at th same time and them if people got to work on different parts it would have gone faster.<br>
    the basic pieces of every Arduino sketch are variables, and digitalWrite, and if you are working with LED's you can use delay, high, low.

<h1> 7/13/17 journal 12: I learned that the positive side faces the power sorce. I also learned how to wire things together. My favorite part about our robots dnce was when it started to do a spin and we actully wanted it too. <br>
  The outputs that Manuala Veloso and Ayanna Howard needed were related to movement. </h1>
